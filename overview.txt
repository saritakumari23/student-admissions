Technical Interview Task

Last date to submit : September  05, 2025

You are tasked with creating a web application where students can submit their applications for admission. The system should include the following functionality:

Application Form: A form where students can submit their details, including personal information, academic background, and relevant documents (e.g., degree certificate,id proof). The form should include basic validation (e.g., required fields, email format, etc.).
Admin Review: An admin interface where the submitted applications can be reviewed. The admin should have the ability to approve or reject each application. Upon approval, the system should generate an admission letter in PDF format containing the student's information and admission details and students can download the same.
Tech Requirements:

The system will be built using Python and the Flask framework.
A relational database (such as MySQL or PostgreSQL) will be used to store application data.
Upon approval of an application, the system will generate a PDF admission letter dynamically and either store it on the server and can be downloaded by the student.
Provide an API or UI for the admin to review, approve, and reject applications.
Additional Requirements:

You are expected to submit Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Functional Requirement Document (FRD) as part of the solution.
Code Submission: After completing the development, push the full code to a Git repository for evaluation.
Include a README file in the repository with the following details:
Project Overview: Briefly describe the project, its functionality, and how to set it up.
Installation Instructions: Step-by-step guide on how to install and run the application locally, including any dependencies and environment setup.
Usage Instructions: How to use the application, including how to submit applications and how the admin can review and approve them.
Testing: Explain how to run the tests, if applicable.
Technology Stack: List the technologies used (e.g., Flask, MySQL/PostgreSQL, PDF generation libraries, etc.).
Assumptions: Any assumptions or design decisions made during the development process.
